Tour booking system for a real company based in Czech Republic.

The idea behind the project is to show users the tours available,
Explore by cities and countries where tours are held.

Project is built using Spring Boot, with a Spring Security Framework layer,
which restricts access to certain pages to users with different roles.

At the moment there are 3 types of roles, ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_ACTUATOR for accessing the Spring actuator.
